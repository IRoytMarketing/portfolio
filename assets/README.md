# Assets Directory

This folder is for storing static files such as PDFs and JPGs.

- Place all PDF and JPG files you wish to serve in this folder.
- Reference these files in your site using: `/assets/filename.pdf` or `/assets/filename.jpg`.
- When deployed (for example, with GitHub Pages or other static hosting), files in this folder will be accessible via these paths.
