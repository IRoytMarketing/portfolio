Our program partners for the NYC 2025 Workshop were Hennessy and the Brooklyn Nets, where we gained hands-on experience in sports marketing while developing our own marketing brief.

I utilized Canva to create polished and professional <em>mock-ups and presentation decks</em> that brought our ideas to life. This effort was reflected in feedback, with a teammate noting, "You worked silently in putting all of our ideas into a deck, putting pen to paper," and another commenting, "You're really good with utilizing Canva." My contributions extended beyond strategy and insights; I also provided creative ideas that shaped the direction of our work. Our final presentation stood out, earning praise as <em>"the only deck that's realistic, clean, and ready to pitch today."</em></p>
